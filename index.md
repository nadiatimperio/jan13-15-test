### Workshop
<p>GitHub is essentially Facebook for code.  You don't need GitHub to use Git and vice versa.  GitHub is also just a way of sharing research or writing.  You will push and pull content on and off of there through the semester.</p>

<p>To check where you are, "pwd". To change directory and go to your desktop for example, "cd ~/desktop/". Then "git config --global user.name "nadiatimperio"". <p/>

<p>You should camelback capitalize for repo names (i.e. nadiaTimperio)<p/>

<p>To create a file called index, "touch index.md" and then to open in it my text editor, "open index.md". To bring what you've been working on to the "attention" of Git, "git add --all" and then add a comment to it "git commit -m "first commit"".<p/>

<p>In GitHub, you can branch! You can create a branch in which you write some stuff that you don't want in your "master" branch, and then you could merge it later, but we shouldn't need to do that unless we're collaberating with others.<p/>

### Class Discussion
Felski, "Critique and the Hermeneutics of Suspicion"
<p>Hermeneutics of Suspicion: trying to figure out the "truth" of a text. Response to this: Over-reading.<p/>
<p> Critique is negative. Critique is against the grain. It has a stance of unveiling the conciousness within which something was produced. OR, reading large umber of texts with a generous description. Describing and redescribing a text and using a computer to do so. Critique is additive actually, and informative. Recovery projects are like this: what gets cannonized over and over again. <p/>
<p> Critique is secondary. It depends on something that has come previously; it is not a primary source. Its existance is dependant on something coming before it (temporality is important to Felski). OR, you can ask if you can replace one word or one idea and see what changes. You could reorder poetry in a collection (conjectural criticism, Carnels?)<p/>
<p> Critique is intellectual. It deliberately seperates itself from emotion. It is self-reflective/aware of itself. OR, you can bring in that which appears to be banal, tedious, annoying, machiney stuff. Stuff that is embodied, that the mind-body doesn't hold. <p/>
<p> Critique comes from below. It is supposed to respond to/go up against authority.<p/>
<p> Critique does not tolerate rivals. <p/>
<p>To think about "arguing with computers," you don't forget about the . What happens if we think about the five things that computers can address. What if you just think about all critique as mediation all the way down? What is my prefered media of study? Do I need to work with codex or can I work with strictly online texts? Galloway will talk about how you read: close reading vs. distance reading. Values about distant readings vs. close readings; witnessing; deep listenings; etc.<p/>
