<p>GitHub is essentially Facebook for code.  You don't need GitHub to use Git and vice versa.  GitHub is also just a way of sharing research or writing.  You will push and pull content on and off of there through the semester.</p>

<p>To check where you are, "pwd". To change directory and go to your desktop for example, "cd ~/desktop/". Then "git config --global user.name "nadiatimperio"". <p/>

<p>You should camelback capitalize for repo names (i.e. nadiaTimperio)<p/>

<p>To create a file called index, "touch index.md" and then to open in it my text editor, "open index.md".<p/>
